# Movie_Sales_Time_Series
Time series analysis from the movie Chicago 2002. Open "Movie_Tickets_Time_Series.ipynb" to view. The project uses the programming language R. 

## Data Extraction

- I used a text file to obtain the time series data

## Initial Data Exploration

- I used ggplot2 to create visualizations so that the reader can understand the data.

- I provide initial hypothesis as to why certain data trends are appearing.

- Used initial hypothesis to create a regression for data taking into account trend and seasonal components.

## Rough Series

- I apply transformations to the data to meet criteria for time series, and then I check to make sure that these criteria are met through data visualization and Box-Ljung test. 

- Interpretted ACF, PACF plots.

- Gave a description along with visuals to explain how time series  models work in laymanâ€™s terms.

- Acquired a ARIMA(1,0,1) model.

## Accuracy of Model

- Used visualizations to determine if the time series improved the accuracy of the model.

## Conclusion

- Described the importance of time series in a practical sense.
